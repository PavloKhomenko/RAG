# Multimodal RAG Assistant

This project is a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with Streamlit. It supports text and image retrieval, chat memory, and web article ingestion for enhanced LLM-based question answering.

---

## Features

* **Multimodal RAG:** Combines chat, articles, and images for context-rich answers.
* **Web Scraping:** Scrape and chunk articles from [deeplearning.ai/the-batch](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/).
* **Image Embeddings:** Store and retrieve relevant images using CLIP.
* **Text Embeddings:** CLIP-based unified vector space for text and image alignment.
* **Chat Memory:** Vector-based chat history for persistent context.
* **Evaluation:** RAGAS-based evaluation pipeline with metrics like faithfulness, answer relevancy, and context precision.

## Architecture Overview

1. **User Input**: A question is submitted via Streamlit.
2. **Text Embedding**: The question is embedded using CLIP (ViT-B-32).
3. **Vector Search**: Contextual chunks and image embeddings are retrieved from Qdrant.
4. **LLM Generation**: The query and context are passed to an OpenAI LLM (GPT-4o).
5. **Response Display**: The answer is shown alongside relevant images and article sources.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd RAG
```

### 2. Python Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.10 or 3.11 recommended):

```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv311
source venv311/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Qdrant Vector Database

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
```

### 5. Configure OpenAI API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Start the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

* Enter a query and click **Search** to receive context-grounded answers.
* Click **Scrape Articles** to ingest latest content from The Batch.
* Click **Clear Chat History** to reset memory in the current session.

### 2. Evaluate RAG Performance

Run the following command to execute RAGAS evaluation:

```bash
python evaluation/metrics.py
```

Make sure your `evaluation/rag_samples.jsonl` contains entries like:

```json
{
  "question": "What is CLIP?",
  "contexts": ["CLIP is a neural network trained on image-text pairs."],
  "answer": "CLIP is a model that connects images and texts.",
  "reference": "CLIP is a model trained on image-text pairs to learn a shared embedding space."
}
```

---

## Evaluation Metrics

* **Faithfulness**: Is the answer actually supported by the retrieved context?
* **Answer Relevancy**: Is the answer on-topic with respect to the question?
* **Context Precision**: Do the retrieved contexts actually help answer the question? *(requires reference)*

RAGAS uses LLM-as-a-judge (e.g., GPT-4) to rate each sample.

---

## Design Decisions

* **CLIP** was used for both text and image embeddings to enable unified retrieval.
* **Qdrant** provides fast approximate search and supports metadata-rich queries.
* **open-clip** enables modern ViT-based CLIP variants with shared embedding spaces.
* **Streamlit** offers a rapid UI for experimenting with RAG workflows.
* **RAGAS** was selected for standardized, explainable evaluation of retrieval+generation.

---

## Future Improvements

* Add inline citations inside generated answers.
* Add support for PDF ingestion and parsing.
* Track chat history per session/user with timestamps.
* Visualize context contribution heatmaps in UI.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Segmentation Faults**: Ensure compatible versions of PyTorch and OpenCLIP are installed.
* **Empty Qdrant results**: Make sure articles are scraped and vectorized properly.
* **Evaluation errors**: Add a `reference` field if using context-related metrics like `context_precision`.
